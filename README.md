This Project is an example Cucumber Selenium test project with **[FluentLenium](https://fluentlenium.com)**.

It uses the [webdrivermanager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager) which carries out the management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) 
of the drivers required by Selenium.
